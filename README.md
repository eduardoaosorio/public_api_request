# public_api_request

Techdegree Project 5

## Description

Small project to simulate an employee directory using the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/).

The program requests a JSON object from the API and parses the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employeeâ€™s birthday and address.

The idea behind the project is to show how to work with public APIs, making API requests, and asynchronously handling the data that will be returned from requests and displayed in the app.
